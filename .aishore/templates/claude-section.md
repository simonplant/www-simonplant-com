## Sprint Orchestration (aishore)

This project uses aishore for autonomous sprint execution. Backlog lives in `backlog/`, tool lives in `.aishore/`.

**Agent rules (mandatory):**
- **Core before features.** The working core — the primary end-to-end path — must pass before feature work proceeds. Check the item's `track` field: `core` items build the foundation; `feature` items decorate it.
- **Intent is the north star.** Every item has a commander's intent field. When steps or AC are ambiguous, follow intent.
- **Prove it runs.** Wire code to real entry points. If the build command exists, run it. If a verify command exists, execute it. Working code that's reachable beats tested code that's isolated.
- **No mocks or stubs** in production code unless the item explicitly requests them.
- **Stay in scope.** Implement only the assigned item. Don't fix unrelated code, add unrequested features, or refactor surrounding code.
- **Commit before signaling.** Always commit with a meaningful message before writing result.json.
